# Instruction how to generate self-signed certs that can be used with the mock web server
# We use the following password = 'android'

# Generate certificate for localhost
openssl req -new -nodes -keyout localhost-key.pem -out localhost-req.pem -days 3650 -subj \
"/C=CZ/ST=Debug/O=FlowCrypt/CN=localhost/emailAddress=admin@flowcrypt.test" -config openssl-req.cnf

# Sign a certificate for localhost via CA. To do that we need to copy generated 'localhost-key.pem'
# and 'localhost-req.pem' to 'docker-mailserver/config/ssl'(as we have 'demoCA' there).
# If we regenerate a cert maybe some changes in 'demoCA' will be required(fix duplicates).
# After that we can call the following command(use 'android' as CA password):
openssl ca -config openssl-ca.cnf -days 3650 -out localhost-cert.pem -infiles localhost-req.pem

# As a result we will receive 'localhost-cert.pem'. In the and of that file we have
# '-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----...'

# Combine certificates for courier, should contains the following info(
# '-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----...' from 'localhost-cert.pem' and
# '-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----...' from 'localhost-key.pem')
-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
...
-----END CERTIFICATE-----
-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----
...
-----END PRIVATE KEY-----
