    <h1>FlowCrypt Privacy Policy</h1>

    <p>The goal is that FlowCrypt will have access to as little information as necessary. The details
        are outlined below.</p>

    <p>This document is the second draft and it is written in Plain English as opposed to Legal
        Language so that it can be readily understood. Please send me feedback if any section needs
        clarification or clearer language.</p>

    <h2>Terminology</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>FLOWCRYPT or WE - FlowCrypt's developers, employees, legal entity or server software that is
            under our direct control
        </li>
        <li>YOU - the user of this software bound by its licence and terms of use</li>
        <li>SERVER HARDWARE - a 3rd party server infrastructure provided as a service to FLOWCRYPT.
            This may include cloud servers and related services
        </li>
        <li>FLOWCRYPT SERVER - server software holding user account related information, and allowing
            storage of encrypted MESSAGE when needed. This software runs on SERVER HARDWARE
        </li>
        <li>ATTESTER - server software necessary to make encrypted PGP communication smooth.
            ATTESTER helps distribute and verify PUBLIC KEYS and runs on SERVER HARDWARE
        </li>
        <li>PUBLIC KEY - Cryptographic information needed in order to encrypt data for someone</li>
        <li>PRIVATE KEY - Cryptographic information needed to open or decrypt previously encrypted
            data for its corresponding PUBLIC KEY. Additionally protected with a PASS PHRASE
        </li>
        <li>PASS PHRASE - A long textual string that is difficult to guess or brute force, used to
            protect the PRIVATE KEY
        </li>
        <li>BRUTE FORCE ATTACK - A method of unlocking encrypted material without breaking the
            underlying encryption, by using vast amounts of computational power to guess all
            possible combinations of a given PASS PHRASE or MESSAGE PASSWORD. This attack method can
            be combined with other methods such as a dictionary attack (the use of words commonly
            found in passwords). The success rate of such attack can vary from very high (simple,
            short PASS PHRASE or MESSAGE PASSWORD) through very low (long, complicated, uncommon and
            hard to guess PASS PHRASE or MESSAGE PASSWORD) to effectively impossible with current
            technology (complex, very long, random PASS PHRASE or MESSAGE PASSWORD)
        </li>
        <li>LOCAL MACHINE - general term for hardware used by end users such as a computer, laptop,
            tablet or a phone
        </li>
        <li>LOCAL APP - FlowCrypt software that runs on LOCAL MACHINE. This may take a form of a
            browser extension or a native application
        </li>
        <li>LOCAL APP CONTACTS - Collection of contacts who use encryption, their PUBLIC KEYs and
            related info stored in LOCAL APP
        </li>
        <li>WEB APP - FlowCrypt software which is served on the web through a link</li>
        <li>PRIVATE WEB APP - is a WEB APP that produces or keeps sensitive MESSAGE CONTENT
            exclusively on LOCAL MACHINE
        </li>
        <!--<li>HASH - data fingerprint that is always consistent for the same data and does not reveal any information about the data itself. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographic_hash_function</li>-->
        <li>EMAIL PROVIDER - person, company or their software who ensures delivery of your email.
            This could be Google, Yahoo, Microsoft, your or other person's private email server, or
            any other that can fulfill this function
        </li>
        <li>ACCESS TOKEN - set of tokens and information needed to access user's account, eg through
            their EMAIL PROVIDER
        </li>
        <li>COMPATIBLE SOFTWARE - Software from other vendors which is able to follow the OpenPGP
            standard of asymmetric key encryption. LOCAL APP or PRIVATE WEB APP Will attempt to find
            out which recipients use COMPATIBLE SOFTWARE by first searching your LOCAL APP CONTACTS
            and if not found, performing a lookup with ATTESTER. For the purpose of this document,
            recipients are considered as having COMPATIBLE SOFTWARE if LOCAL APP or PRIVATE WEB APP
            has access to recipient's PUBLIC KEY
        </li>
        <li>PLAIN TEXT - message that has not been encrypted, and may be readable by anyone handling
            it
        </li>
        <li>MESSAGE - encrypted text data that may or may not include encrypted attachments.
            Typically in the format of an email with certain parts of the email encrypted
        </li>
        <li>MESSAGE PASSWORD - one-time password used to encrypt MESSAGE when recipient doesn't have
            COMPATIBLE SOFTWARE
        </li>
        <li>CONTENT - the actual meaningful information contained inside MESSAGE, accessible to
            anyone with corresponding PRIVATE KEY or MESSAGE PASSWORD
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>End-to-end encryption</h2>
    <p>Regardless of the method of MESSAGE delivery, FlowCrypt is an end-to-end encryption software.
        That means the CONTENT of your MESSAGE is encrypted in LOCAL APP or PRIVATE WEB APP and then
        sent to the recipient encrypted. How the MESSAGE is handled by the recipient depends on
        their setup. The vast majority of compatible software will only decrypt your MESSAGEs on the
        recipient's LOCAL MACHINE. That means neither EMAIL PROVIDER or FLOWCRYPT can access the
        CONTENT of the MESSAGE in transit or at rest.</p>

    <h2>Email ACCESS TOKEN</h2>
    <p>ACCESS TOKEN needed to access user's email is exclusively stored in LOCAL APP on user's LOCAL
        MACHINE, no exceptions. ACCESS TOKEN is used solely within LOCAL APP for user
        authentication, sending and receiving of MESSAGES and other related actions that make LOCAL
        APP work smoothly.</p>

    <h2>MESSAGE delivery and storage</h2>
    <p>When you message a recipient who has COMPATIBLE SOFTWARE, the encrypted message is
        transferred from your EMAIL PROVIDER to recipient's EMAIL PROVIDER. This includes any
        attachments. How the encrypted data is transferred and stored and what happens to the
        MESSAGE is at the sole discretion of respective EMAIL PROVIDERs. EMAIL PROVIDER will see who
        you are messaging, how often, the email subject and related meta information just like they
        do when you send PLAIN TEXT email. The mechanics of sending encrypted email is the same as
        PLAIN TEXT email, except EMAIL PROVIDER is not able to see the CONTENT of these
        MESSAGEs.</p>
    <p>When any of your recipients do not have COMPATIBLE SOFTWARE, LOCAL APP or PRIVATE WEB APP
        will require a MESSAGE PASSWORD to be provided by sender. Anyone who has access to the
        MESSAGE PASSWORD can open such MESSAGE. The encrypted MESSAGE is then sent through EMAIL
        PROVIDERs the same way as above. In addition, encrypted MESSAGE will be stored on FLOWCRYPT
        SERVER. This helps recipients without COMPATIBLE SOFTWARE to open such messages and view
        their CONTENT through the use of PRIVATE WEB APP. When the recipient doesn't have COMPATIBLE
        SOFTWARE and the encrypted MESSAGE is relayed through FLOWCRYPT SERVER, following information
        is stored along with it: (a) date and time MESSAGE was sent, (b) size of MESSAGE, (c) the
        encrypted MESSAGE, (d) message expiration time, (e): indication if this is a MESSAGE text or
        attachment, (f) sender of MESSAGE only if this is an attachment and this particular MESSAGE
        never expires. MESSAGE that is not an attachment or is set to expire at a future date will
        not have any sender associated with it on FLOWCRYPT SERVER. Because MESSAGE PASSWORD can be
        subject to a BRUTE FORCE ATTACK, it is advisable to use a MESSAGE PASSWORD of sufficient
        strength for your particular use case.</p>

    <h2>Handling MESSAGE PASSWORDs and PASS PHRASEs</h2>
    <p>FLOWCRYPT will never have access to user PRIVATE KEYs, MESSAGE PASSWORDs or PASS PHRASEs. LOCAL
        APP is intended to never send such information to FLOWCRYPT SERVER or ATTESTER.</p>
    <p>LOCAL APP, PRIVATE WEB APP or any other FLOWCRYPT software will not distribute PASS PHRASEs or
        MESSAGE PASSWORDs in any way. Safe storage, backup and distribution of this material is left
        solely on the user.</p>
    <p>If any user intentionally or unintentionally sends a PRIVATE KEY, MESSAGE PASSWORD or PASS
        PHRASE to FLOWCRYPT (please do not do that!), FLOWCRYPT will delete such information immediately
        upon noticing it, unless the user explicitly indicated that this material is solely for
        testing purposes. In either case, users should consider such keys not trusted and
        compromised, and should avoid using them in production scenarios.</p>

    <h2>Handling of PRIVATE KEYs</h2>
    <p>LOCAL APP will store PRIVATE KEYs in storage accessible only to LOCAL MACHINE such as browser
        storage, application storage, hard drive or similar, and the security of these PRIVATE KEYs
        depend on the security of the underlying LOCAL MACHINE that keeps them. For this reason, it
        is advised to always update to latest operating system, keep up to date with latest security
        fixes, keep the system virus free using reliable antivirus software, using full-disk
        encryption or any other practices that make LOCAL MACHINE less vulnerable to attackers.
        Additionally, FLOWCRYPT recommends that you select an option to "Always require a pass phrase
        when opening email" as an additional layer of security in case your LOCAL MACHINE gets
        compromised in the future through physical or other means.</p>
    <p>In addition to storing PRIVATE KEY in LOCAL APP exclusive to LOCAL MACHINE, depending on how
        was LOCAL APP set up, following will apply:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><u>Option 1 - manual setup - use (import) my own key</u>: LOCAL APP will keep both the
            PRIVATE KEY and PASS PHRASE exclusively on LOCAL MACHINE, unless user specifically
            navigates to backup section of settings where they perform an additional form of PRIVATE
            KEY backup.
        </li>
        <li><u>Option 2 - manual setup - create a new key</u>: LOCAL APP will provide the user with
            a comprehensive estimation of the strength of their PASS PHRASE. Once the user chooses a
            PASS PHRASE of satisfactory strength depending on their use case, LOCAL APP will store
            the PASS PHRASE and the PRIVATE KEY on LOCAL MACHINE. In addition, as a part of the
            setup procedure, LOCAL APP will ask user to select an additional method of PRIVATE KEY
            backup, if needed. User is free to select a backup method or choose not to perform any
            backup.
        </li>
        <li><u>Option 3 - simple setup - create a new key</u>: LOCAL APP will provide the user with
            a comprehensive estimation of the strength of their PASS PHRASE. Once the user chooses a
            PASS PHRASE of satisfactory strength depending on their use case, LOCAL APP will store
            the PASS PHRASE and the PRIVATE KEY on LOCAL MACHINE. In addition, LOCAL APP will
            automatically back up the key on user's EMAIL PROVIDER. The backed up key is protected
            with a PASS PHRASE that will always stay exclusively on LOCAL APP within LOCAL MACHINE.
            It is strongly recommended to choose a PASS PHRASE that will be evaluated to maximum
            strength (full strength bar) during LOCAL APP setup, as PASS PHRASEs of such strength
            take vast amount of resources to crack through BRUTE FORCE ATTACK, making such attacks
            effectively impossible.
        </li>
    </ul>
